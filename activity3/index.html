    Fresh vegetables, olive oil, herbs, and seafood are the 
    cornerstones of Greek food. No wonder it’s considered one 
    of the <strong>healthiest</strong> Mediterranean diets.

<h2>Feta & Parsley Fries</h2>
<img src="images/fries.png" width="300" height="400"> 
<p id="fetaparsleyfries"><em><b>
    These crispy Greek fries are the ultimate side dish! 
    They’re showered with Mediterranean-style toppings: 
    feta cheese, onion and herbs.
</b></em></p>
<h3 class="thingsyouneed">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 medium Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon homemade Greek Seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped curly parsley</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion</li>
    <li>Dried oregano</li>
    <li>Dried dill</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Onion powder</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup feta cheese crumbles</li>
    <li>Red onion</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley</li>
    <li>Lemon dill sauce</li>
    <li>Tzatziki</li>
    <li>Aioli</li>
    <li>4 lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="importantsteps">Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. 
        Evenly space the oven racks to ensure even cooking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into fries: 
        (Watch this video or use a fry cutter.) Wash the potatoes, 
        leaving the skins on. Slice off the ends of each potato, 
        then slice off part of the side to make a base. Place the potato 
        half cut side down and cut off a 3/8-inch slice, then lay the slice 
        on its side and cut it into several long strips. Repeat until all 
        potatoes have been cut into fries. The pieces can be uneven, but aim 
        for as uniform of thickness as possible. See the video for full instructions!
    </li>
    <li>
        Soak in cold water (10 minutes): Place the cut fries into a medium 
        bowl and rinse with cold water until water is clear. Then fill the bowl 
        with cold water and allow to rest for 10 minutes (while the oven 
        preheats). Then drain the potatoes and dry them thoroughly with a 
        clean dish towel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Season the fries: Add the fries to a dry bowl and toss them with the 
        olive oil, Greek seasoning and kosher salt. Line two baking sheets with 
        parchment paper. Spread the fries in straight lines on the paper, placing 
        them as far apart as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake: Bake the fries for 20 minutes. Take them out of the oven and 
        carefully flip each fry. Return to oven (reversing the pans on top 
        and bottom racks). Bake additional 8 to 10 minutes until they are 
        crisp and golden brown, watching carefully as the bake time depends 
        on the fry thickness and your oven. (If the majority of the fries seem 
        soft, continue to bake a few more minutes.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Season: Taste and add a few more pinches salt if desired. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Garnish: Transfer fries to a platter and top with the feta cheese 
        crumbles, breaking larger chunks into small pieces with your fingers. 
        Add the finely chopped parsley and red onion. Serve with lemon wedges 
        and tzatziki or lemon dill sauce.
    </li>

</b></em></p>
<h3 class="thingsyouneed">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 lbs chicken tenders</li>
    <li>1 cup Greek yogurt (you can use reduced fat or fat free Greek yogurt if you like)</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 large lemon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon Greek extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, generous pinch to taste</li>
    <li>Black pepper, generous pinch to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup fresh mint leaves</li>
    <li>Pita bread</li>
    <li>Homemade tztaziki sauce</li>
    <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
    <li>1 cucumber, sliced</li>
    <li>1 green pepper, cored and sliced</li>
    <li>1 small red onion, sliced into half moons</li>
    <li>Pitted kalamata olives</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="importantsteps">Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        In a larger mixing bowl, combine the marinade ingredients, mix well. 
        Add the chicken tenders and mix to make sure chicken is well coated 
        with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or 
        refrigerate overnight.) Meanwhile, make Tztaziki sauce according to 
        this recipe, and prepare the pita and other gyro fixings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a non-stick skillet over 
        medium-high until shimmering but not smoking. Add chicken tenders to 
        the pan (make sure to shake off any excess marinade before adding 
        chicken to the pan.) Cook on one side undisturbed for 5 minutes until 
        browned. Using a pair of tongs, turn chicken over and cook on other side 
        for another 5 minutes or until chicken is done. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Warm up some pita. Spread Tztaziki sauce on top, then add chicken 
        (about 2 to 3 tenders) and top with tomato, cucumber, green pepper, 
        red onion and olives as you like. Wrap the pita up and enjoy!

    <li>6 tablespoons orange juice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup crushed walnuts</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons cognac (optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon orange zest</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>

    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup crushed walnuts</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="importantsteps">Instructions</h3>
<h4>To make the cookie dough:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and 
        line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a large bowl, combine olive oil, orange juice, sugar, crushed 
        walnuts, honey, cognac (if using), and orange zest.
    </li>
    <li>
        In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, 
        baking soda, salt, cloves, and cinnamon.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine the wet and dry ingredients and knead with your hands 
        for a few minutes to incorporate the oil into the flour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Working with one tablespoon of dough at a time, roll into 
        oval shapes, flatten slightly and place onto the prepared 
        baking sheets 2 inches (5cm) apart.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press the tops to the cookies with a fork to make a few indentations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown. Let cool 
        completely before proceeding.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>To make the honey syrup:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Once the cookies are cooled, make the syrup: combine the honey and 
        water in a wide, shallow saucepan and heat until simmering.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the syrup is heating, combine the crushed walnuts and sesame 
        seeds in a small bowl and set near the syrup.
    </li>
    <li>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, sprinkle with half 
        of the walnut-sesame mixture, and place near the syrup.
    </li>
    <li>
        Working with a few cookies at a time, dip the cookies 
        in the warm syrup, coating both sides.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lift gently out of the syrup and back onto the parchment-lined, 
        walnut sprinkled cookie sheet. Sprinkle the tops with some of 
        the remaining crushed walnuts and sesame seeds. Repeat with the 
        remaining cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once cooled, store these cookies in a single layer in a parchment-lined, 
        airtight container or in individual paper muffin liners. These cookies 
        can be stored at room temperature for up to 5 days.
    </li>
